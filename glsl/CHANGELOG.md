# 1.0

> Thu 18th of July 2019

  - Migrate all parsers to [nom-5](https://crates.io/crates/nom/5.0.0).
  - Improve and add unit and integration tests.
  - Improve overall documentation.
  - Enhance some allocation scheme (removed them by using more adapted parsers).
  - Completely remove the byte (`&[u8]`) parsing. That was a bad idea, for both its impractical
    aspect and error removing. Parsing is done on string slices now (`&str`).

## 0.13.5

> Sun 9th of December 2018

  - Add the SPIR-V transpiler. Currently, it’s feature-gated and *very* experimental. Feel free to
    try and provide feedback about it.
  - Add simple accessors for `ParseResult`.
  - Fix a typo in the documentation of syntax.
  - Add some unit and integration tests.
  - Add `Identifier::as_str` and `TypeName::as_str`

## 0.13.4

> Wed 25nd of November 2018

  - Add `NonEmpty::push` and `NonEmpty::pop`.
  - Implement `Deref` and `DerefMut` for `TranslationUnit`.

## 0.13.3

> Wed 24nd of November 2018

  - Add `NonEmpty::from_iter` and `TranslationUnit::from_iter`.
  - Implement `IntoIterator` for `NonEmpty` and `TranslationUnit`.

## 0.13.2

> Wed 22nd of November 2018

  - Fix a typo in documentation.

## 0.13.1

> Wed 22nd of November 2018

  - Fix a link in documentation.

# 0.13

> Wed 21st of November 2018

  - Update/reset hyperlinks in all the documentation for types, traits, methods, etc.
  - General enhancement of the documentation.
  - `ExternalDeclaration::new_struct` can now fail. Check the doc for further details.
  - `NonEmpty`, `Identifier` and `TypeName` and `TranslationUnit` are now plain types and not
    aliases anymore.
  - Add AST visitors. Visitors allow for traversing through an AST and on-the-fly mutation,
    filtering, etc.
  - The `#define` preprocessor pragma is now supported in a limited form (it can only be used in
    the global scope).

# 0.12

> Sun 11th of November 2018

  - Fix the type of identifier stored in `Block`: it now uses the new encoding for arrayed
    identifiers.
  - `Block` parsers update for the arrayd identifier change.

# 0.11

> Sat 10th of November 2018

  - Add helper functions to build objects form the `syntax` module. Those are intended to be a
    simple way to build ASTs out of Rust code instead of parsing.
  - Enhance the documentation of the `Preprocessor` type.

## 0.10.1

> Fri 2nd of November 2018

  - Add some missing implementors of `Parse` for types from `glsl::syntax`.

# 0.10

> Fri 2nd of November 2018

  - Hide the `parsers` module. It’s not exposed anymore as it was mostly
    [nom](https://crates.io/crates/nom) parsers and we don’t like leaking internals.
  - Introduce the `Parser` trait, acting as an abstraction over the internal parsers. Implementors
    provide a type-driven parsing experience that is very similar to the one as
    [FromStr](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/str/trait.FromStr.html). This change is actually
    mandatory for the [glsl-quasiquote](https://crates.io/crates/glsl-quasiquote) crate’s `glsl!`
    proc-macro to allow people use it for any GLSL item (and not only `TranslationUnit`).
  - Enhance the overall documentation.

## 0.9.2

> Wed 3rd of October 2018

  - Fix GLSL transpiled representation of `IVec*`. It was plain wrong.

## 0.9.1

> Sat 7th of July 2018

  - Fix unit testing in transpilers.

# 0.9

> Sat 7th of July 2018

  - Big cleanup of the module hierarchy.
  - Enhanced the documentation.

## 0.8.1

> Sun, 17th of June 2018

  - Add the `README.md` path to the `Cargo.toml` manifest.

# 0.8

> Sun 17th of June 2018

This version introduces breaking changes because public types used in return positions have changed.
These concern only intermediate `nom` functions, so if you do not make a fancy use of this crate,
you souldn’t have to worry too much when migrating.

  - Fix the roundtrip issue with the GLSL writer (precedence wasn’t correctly respected).
  - Simplify internal code.
  - Error instead of panicking when parsing overflowing integer literals.
  - Fix panic trying to parse literals starting with whitespace.
  - Add fuzzing to find out panics.

## 0.7.2

> Wed 13th of December 2017

  - Fix the `show_expr` when the `Expr` is a `Expr::UIntConst`.

## 0.7.1

> Mon 20th of November 2017

  - `std::error::Error` is now implemented for `ParseError`.

# 0.7

> Wed 27th of September 2017

  - Add support for postfix expressions as function identifiers.

## 0.6.5

> Mon 4th of September 2017

  - Fix the formatting of floating values when the fractional part is `0`.

## 0.6.4

> Mon 4th of September 2017

  - Fix the output for `show_struct_specifier`.

## 0.6.3

> Mon 4th of September 2017

  - Fix the output for `show_struct_specifier`.

## 0.6.2

> Mon 4th of September 2017

  - Remove a warning.

## 0.6.1

> Mon 4th of September 2017

  - Fix `show_struct_specifier`.

# 0.6

> Fri 1st of September 2017

  - The `TypeSpecifier` type was wrong as it didn’t carry any `ArraySpecifier` information while the
    GLSL specification’s grammar about type specifiers states they should. Fixed.

# 0.5

> Mon 7th of August 2017

  - The `parse` and `parse_str` functions now take as second argument the parser to run. This enables
    using those functions and all the neat logic the wrap in dependent projects.

## 0.4.2

> Fri 4th of August 2017

  - A GLSL writer is now available.
  - Some parsers yield non-empty list of syntax trees. Those had the incorrect `Vec` type. They were
    replaced by `NonEmpty`, which is an alias to `Vec`, but carry the semantic that it has at least
    one element in it.

## 0.4.1

> Thu 3rd of August 2017

  - Uni/multi-line comments are now supported.

# 0.4

> Wed 2nd of August 2017

  - The `Declaration::Block` variant was refactored for a better usage.
  - Dot field selections and, in a mory general way, postfix expressions completely fixed. The
    `syntax` module was altered to make it easier to work with dot field selection. Also related,
    the function identifier syntax is now isomorphic to an identifier.

## 0.3.1

> Tue 1st of August 2017

  - Fix the `preprocessor` parser so that it eats surrounding blanks.

# 0.3

> Mon 31st of July 2017

  - Add a very minimalistic yet working preprocessor. It parses `#version` and `#extension`
    commands. Those have to be declared at the top of your file, even though this implementation
    accepts them at any place an external declaration could be defined. Feel free to submit a PR
    if you want to change that behavior, I don’t really mind.
  - Enhance the runtime error reporting. It’s not perfect, but it’s way better than before!
  - `void` is now recognized as `TypeSpecifier::Void` instead of the erroneous
    `TypeSpecifier::TypeName("void")`.

## 0.2.2

> Mon 31st of July 2017

  - The `layout` parser had a nasty bug that would treat a list of key-value pairs as an expression
    assignment. This was fixed and it now treats it as a list of pairs of identifier associated with a
    possible constant expression.
  - The `StructFieldSpecifier` type and its associated parser were wrong. Was missing:
    + the type qualifier
    + for each identifier defined in the field specifier, its optional array specifier, as in
      `float foo[3];` or `vec3 bar[];` for unsized ones.

## 0.2.1

> Sun 30th of July 2017

  - More documentation to help people to get their feet wet.

# 0.2

> Sat 29th of July 2017

  - The whole parsing API is public.

# 0.1

  - Initial revision.
