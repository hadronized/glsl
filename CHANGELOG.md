## 0.9.1

> Saturday, July, 7th 2018

  - Fix unit testing in transpilers.

# 0.9

> Saturday, July, 7th 2018

  - Big cleanup of the module hierarchy.
  - Enhanced the documentation.

## 0.8.1

> Sunday, June, 17th 2018

  - Add the `README.md` path to the `Cargo.toml` manifest.

# 0.8

> Sunday, June, 17th 2018

This version introduces breaking changes because public types used in return positions have changed.
These concern only intermediate `nom` functions, so if you do not make a fancy use of this crate,
you souldn’t have to worry too much when migrating.

  - Fix the roundtrip issue with the GLSL writer (precedence wasn’t correctly respected).
  - Simplify internal code.
  - Error instead of panicking when parsing overflowing integer literals.
  - Fix panic trying to parse literals starting with whitespace.
  - Add fuzzing to find out panics.

## 0.7.2

> Wednesday, December, 13th 2017

  - Fix the `show_expr` when the `Expr` is a `Expr::UIntConst`.

## 0.7.1

> Monday, November, 20th 2017

  - `std::error::Error` is now implemented for `ParseError`.

# 0.7

> Wednesday, September, 27th 2017

  - Add support for postfix expressions as function identifiers.

## 0.6.5

> Monday, September, 4th 2017

  - Fix the formatting of floating values when the fractional part is `0`.

## 0.6.4

> Monday, September, 4th 2017

  - Fix the output for `show_struct_specifier`.

## 0.6.3

> Monday, September, 4th 2017

  - Fix the output for `show_struct_specifier`.

## 0.6.2

> Monday, September, 4th 2017

  - Remove a warning.

## 0.6.1

> Monday, September, 4th 2017

  - Fix `show_struct_specifier`.

# 0.6

> Friday, September, 1st 2017

  - The `TypeSpecifier` type was wrong as it didn’t carry any `ArraySpecifier` information while the
    GLSL specification’s grammar about type specifiers states they should. Fixed.

# 0.5

> Monday, August, 7th 2017

  - The `parse` and `parse_str` functions now take as second argument the parser to run. This enables
    using those functions and all the neat logic the wrap in dependent projects.

## 0.4.2

> Friday, August, 4th 2017

  - A GLSL writer is now available.
  - Some parsers yield non-empty list of syntax trees. Those had the incorrect `Vec` type. They were
    replaced by `NonEmpty`, which is an alias to `Vec`, but carry the semantic that it has at least
    one element in it.

## 0.4.1

> Thursday, August, 3rd 2017

  - Uni/multi-line comments are now supported.

# 0.4

> Wednesday, August, 2nd 2017

  - The `Declaration::Block` variant was refactored for a better usage.
  - Dot field selections and, in a mory general way, postfix expressions completely fixed. The
    `syntax` module was altered to make it easier to work with dot field selection. Also related,
    the function identifier syntax is now isomorphic to an identifier.

## 0.3.1

> Tuesday, August, 1st 2017

  - Fix the `preprocessor` parser so that it eats surrounding blanks.

# 0.3

> Monday, July, 31st 2017

  - Add a very minimalistic yet working preprocessor. It parses `#version` and `#extension`
    commands. Those have to be declared at the top of your file, even though this implementation
    accepts them at any place an external declaration could be defined. Feel free to submit a PR
    if you want to change that behavior, I don’t really mind.
  - Enhance the runtime error reporting. It’s not perfect, but it’s way better than before!
  - `void` is now recognized as `TypeSpecifier::Void` instead of the erroneous
    `TypeSpecifier::TypeName("void")`.

## 0.2.2

> Monday, July, 31st 2017

  - The `layout` parser had a nasty bug that would treat a list of key-value pairs as an expression
    assignment. This was fixed and it now treats it as a list of pairs of identifier associated with a
    possible constant expression.
  - The `StructFieldSpecifier` type and its associated parser were wrong. Was missing:
    + the type qualifier
    + for each identifier defined in the field specifier, its optional array specifier, as in
      `float foo[3];` or `vec3 bar[];` for unsized ones.

## 0.2.1

> Sunday, July, 30th 2017

  - More documentation to help people to get their feet wet.

# 0.2

> Saturday, July, 29th 2017

  - The whole parsing API is public.

# 0.1

  - Initial revision.
